The ICC Men's T20 World Cup (formerly the ICC World Twenty20) is a biennial T20 cricket tournament, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) every 2 years since its inauguration in 2007 with the exception of 2011, 2018 and 2020. This event was rebranded from ICC World Twenty20 to ICC Men's T20 World Cup in November 2018.[1] India are the current champions and also the joint most successful side with West Indies and England after winning their 2nd title in the 2024 Tournament.

The 2011 edition of the tournament was preponed to 2010 due to its replacement with the ICC Champions Trophy 2010. This scheduling bottleneck was caused after the 5th Edition of the ICC Champions Trophy, scheduled to be hosted by Pakistan in 2008 was delayed and shifted to South Africa in 2009 due to security concerns.[2] The Champions Trophy was converted into a quadrennial tournament after that.
